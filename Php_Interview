SQL Injection

1) SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.
2) SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.
3) SQL Injection is a security vulnerability where an attacker inserts (or “injects”) malicious SQL code into your application’s database queries.

How to Avoid SQL Injection

1. Use Prepared Statements (MOST IMPORTANT)
	Example using PDO (recommended) - PHP Data Objects (PDO is a database abstraction layer in PHP.)
	Example using MySQLi

2. Never put user input directly into queries
3. Validate & Sanitize Inputs
4. Use Stored Procedures (Optional)
5. Limit Database Privileges

What is OOPS?

OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming System) is a programming approach where we write code using objects and classes instead of only functions.

Basic OOPS Terms

Class → Blueprint

Object → Real instance of a class 

Quick Interview Summary 📌
Pillar	        Meaning
Encapsulation	Data hiding using access modifiers
Inheritance	Parent → Child
Polymorphism	Same method, different behavior
Abstraction	Hide implementation, show functionality

6) Encapsulation
Encapsulation means wrapping data (variables) and methods inside a class and restricting direct access using access modifiers. 👉 Example. Public,private,protected.

7) Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties and methods of another class using extends. 👉 Example. Base Model, Base Controller

8) Polymorphism
Polymorphism means same method name but different behavior depending on the object. 

9) Abstraction
Hiding implementation details, showing only essential features or functionality. 👉 Example. Model called inside Controller

10) Access Modifiers
📌 public, protected, private

public → anywhere

protected → class + child

private → same class only

11) Constructor

Automatically called when object is created

12) Destructor

Called when object is destroyed.

13) What is static?

Belongs to class, not object

Access using ::

14) What is a Trait?

Used to reuse functionality or code across in multiple classes.

15) final keyword

Prevents inheritance or overriding.

16) Difference between self and this

$this → current object

self:: → current class

17) List of Magic Constants (Most Important)
Magic constants are predefined PHP constants commonly used for debugging, logging, and file path management in MVC applications.

Magic Constant	Meaning
__LINE__	Current line number
__FILE__	Full file path
__DIR__	        Directory of the file
__FUNCTION__	Function name
__CLASS__	Class name
__METHOD__	Class method name
__NAMESPACE__	Current namespace

⚡ Most Asked in Interviews

__FILE__, __DIR__ → path handling

__CLASS__, __METHOD__ → logging

__LINE__ → debugging

18) Microservices is an architecture where an application is split into small, 
independent services that communicate through APIs and can be developed and deployed separately.
